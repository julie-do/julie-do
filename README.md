# Julie Do | ABOUT ME

My name is Julie Do and I'm a Fullstack Web Developer based in Orange County, CA with a focus on Typescript and ReactJS. As a software engineer, I enjoy expanding my skillset and learning the new technologies that are constantly changing the world around us. I graduated with a 3.9 GPA magna cum laude from California State University of Long Beach with a bachelor's degree in computer science in the Spring of 2020. In the future, I want to learn and become skilled enough to make any cool ideas I have without any limitations. I am currently looking for a job, so if you're interested, please contact me at julienhudo.dev@gmail.com!
